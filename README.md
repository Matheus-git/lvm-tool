![Bash Script](https://img.shields.io/badge/bash_script-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=gnu-bash&logoColor=white)

LVM Manager is a Bash-based tool designed to simplify the management of Logical Volume Manager (LVM) on Linux systems. It provides an interactive menu for:

- Physical Volumes (PVs)
- Volume Groups (VGs)
- Logical Volumes (LVs)

**This project was developed in just a few hours as part of a training exercise over the weekend.**

## Requirements

- **Bash**: The script is written in Bash and should be run in a Bash shell.
- **LVM tools**: Ensure that LVM tools (lvm2) are installed on your system.

## Usage

1. **Make the script executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x sysinfo.sh
   ```
2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   sudo bash ./lvm-manager.sh
   ```
3. **Follow the menu prompts**:
   - The script will display a menu with options to view specific system information or display all details.
   - Enter the corresponding number for the information you want to view.

## Improvements

- **Add "Remove Option" to Each Manager**: Introduce a "Remove" option within every manager for streamlined functionality.
- **Snapshot Manager**: Create Snapshot Manager.

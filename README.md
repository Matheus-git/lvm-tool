LVM Manager is a Bash-based tool designed to simplify the management of Logical Volume Manager (LVM) on Linux systems. It provides an interactive menu for creating, listing and resizing:

    -Physical Volumes (PVs)
    -Volume Groups (VGs)
    -Logical Volumes (LVs)

**This project was developed in just a few hours as part of a training exercise over the weekend.**
